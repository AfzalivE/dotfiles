This repo is mostly unmaintained. My real omz (oh-my-zsh) configs live in a private repo.

## YMD75 v3 for Mac

The firmware file contains a QMK firmware for YMD75 v3 PCB with a custom keymap more suited to a Mac user.

Along with this, the Karabiner Elements config really completes it. It contains the following _Complex Modifications_:
1. Change caps_lock key to command+control+option+shift. (Post escape key when pressed alone)
1. Change control + delete to forward delete
1. Change command+F14 to command+option+power (locks the screen)
